ngLara
=====================

ngLara provides the basis to start your project with (AngularJS + Laravel Framework)

Laravel and Angular have both become very well renowned tools in the web development world lately. Laravel for the great things it brings to the PHP community and Angular for the amazing frontend tools and its simplicity. Combining these two great frameworks only seems like the logical next step.

I used Laravel as the RESTful API backend and Angular as the frontend. ngLara included preloads angular, angular-route, angular-strap, and angular-animate.
